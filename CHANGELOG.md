# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **`ODOO_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`**: comma-separated `Host` headers to accept for the `streamable-http` transport (DNS-rebinding protection). Needed when running behind a reverse proxy that forwards an external host; unset preserves the prior default (no host validation) (#45, @Miriup).
- **`ODOO_MCP_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT`**: seconds of inactivity before a `streamable-http` session is closed and its server-side state freed; unset preserves the prior behavior (sessions never expire).

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: refreshed the lockfile — `mcp` 1.26.0 → 1.27.2 (streamable-http idle timeout, mid-request transport-close handling, pydantic 2.13 compat), `pydantic` 2.11 → 2.13, `starlette` 0.47 → 1.3, plus dev tooling (ruff, ty, pytest 9). Full suite green against the new stack.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **`delete_record` on records without a display name** (e.g. `mail.message`): the unlink succeeded but the result then failed schema validation (`deleted_name` received Odoo's `False`), so clients believed the delete had failed — now falls back to an ID label.
- **Timeouts**: Socket timeouts now actually apply to XML-RPC connections — a hung Odoo server fails fast instead of blocking forever.
- **Half-open keepalive recovery** (#68): a timeout on a reused keepalive socket (LB dropped the upstream without FIN/RST) transparently retries once on a fresh connection — idempotent calls only: read-only model methods plus login/version/db-list probes (a timed-out write is never re-sent, it could be double-executed by a slow server); timeouts on fresh connections are NOT retried.
- **streamable-http sessions** (#70): the Odoo connection and registered handlers now persist across HTTP sessions — previously every tool call after the first failed with "Not authenticated with Odoo" because session teardown disconnected Odoo. stdio still cleans up on exit.
- **Event loop**: Blocking XML-RPC/HTTP calls offloaded to worker threads; concurrent tool calls and pings stay responsive during slow operations.
- **YOLO `list_models`**: System-model exclusion was a no-op (tautological domain) — results were dominated by `ir.*`/`base.*` models.
- **Domain parsing**: String domains no longer corrupt values containing `True`/`False` substrings (e.g. `'True North'`).
- **Binary fields**: `search_records`/`get_record` results with binary/datetime fields serialize cleanly instead of erroring.
- **`fields=[]`**: Treated as smart defaults instead of silently fetching ALL fields.
- **`list_resource_templates`**: YOLO mode reports "all models available" instead of `total_models: 0`.
- **Search resource**: `odoo://{model}/search` skips binary/html fields like the record path; pagination hints now reference the `search_records` tool instead of emitting unroutable query-param URIs.
- **Formatters**: Float precision honors `digits` metadata; unset names render `Record {id}` instead of `False`; long values truncated with a marker; x2many "View all" hints carry real record ids.
- **Cache**: Memory budget actually enforced (looped eviction); replacing a key no longer evicts an unrelated entry.
- **Error sanitizer**: Server tracebacks reduced to the final error message (multi-line business errors kept intact) — no more leaked source lines, SQL constraint names, or row values; no more literal `{}` placeholders in error messages.
- **Error classification**: Builtin `PermissionError`/`ConnectionError` no longer misclassified as critical system errors (custom classes shadowed the builtins); access-control infrastructure failures report as connection errors, not "Access denied".
- **Config precedence**: `ODOO_MCP_TRANSPORT`/`HOST`/`PORT`/`LOG_LEVEL` set only in `.env` now take effect; invalid `ODOO_MCP_PORT` or `ODOO_MCP_SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD_MS` no longer crash startup/import with raw tracebacks.
- **Auth fallback**: After a rejected API key falls back to password auth, permission checks use session auth instead of resending the dead key (which 401'd every tool call).
- **Logging**: Sensitive keys (passwords, API keys, tokens) redacted in debug-log write payloads; database names moved to DEBUG level.
- **Version**: `SERVER_VERSION` derives from the package version; a test pins it to pyproject.toml (v0.5.2 shipped reporting 0.5.1).

### Changed
- **TLS**: HTTPS transports share one `ssl.SSLContext` to amortize handshake cost across the per-proxy sockets introduced in 0.6.0.
- **HTTP transport**: Loud startup warning when binding a non-loopback host (the transport has no built-in authentication); README security notes added.
- **Dead code removed** (~550 lines): never-wired record/permission caches, `RequestOptimizer`, the browse resource chain, and the unused error metrics/conversion API; `ConnectionPool` simplified to the proxy factory it actually was.
- **CI**: Push trigger limited to `main`/`dev` (PRs cover feature branches; kills duplicate runs); Dependabot switched to the `uv` ecosystem so `uv.lock` gets update/security PRs; publish workflow verifies the built version against the release tag (manual dispatch requires typed version confirmation); Python 3.13 classifier added; MCP integration job skips Dependabot PRs — repository secrets aren't available to them, so the private-module checkout failed with "Input required and not supplied: token"; Dependabot version-update PRs now target `dev` directly (manual retargeting desynced Dependabot's base-branch metadata); codecov-action bumped to v7 (supersedes the stuck Dependabot PR).
- **`--help`**: documents `ODOO_MCP_ENABLE_METHOD_CALLS`.
- **Tests**: integration suite hardened — MCP-module detection works on multi-database instances (health probe sends `X-Odoo-Database`); an env-var leak that wedged spawned transport servers under DEBUG logging fixed; vacuous `if records:` guards replaced with real fixtures and assertions; MCP test client `read_resource` returned `""` (matched the wrong content type).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **`aggregate_records` tool**: Server-side aggregation via Odoo's grouping methods (#64). Dispatches to `formatted_read_group` on Odoo 19+ and falls back to `read_group` with response normalization on older versions.
- **`call_model_method` tool** (YOLO-only, opt-in via `ODOO_MCP_ENABLE_METHOD_CALLS`): generic XML-RPC `execute_kw` escape hatch for workflow actions not covered by CRUD.

### Fixed
- **Concurrent tool calls**: Per-proxy XML-RPC transport prevents wire-state corruption when multiple tools run in parallel (#44).
- **CI**: Disable MCP rate limiting in integration tests — the 300/min ceiling tripped mid-suite under the shared admin API key. Production keeps the default.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **`post_message` tool**: Post to an Odoo record's chatter via `mail.thread.message_post()` (#50).

### Fixed
- **Stdio transport**: Drop terminal `notifications/progress` from `search_records` and `list_models` — strict MCP clients treated the post-response notification as a fatal protocol error and tore down the transport.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **CI**: Skip MCP integration tests for fork PRs where repository secrets are unavailable
- **Search**: Cap over-limit to `max_limit` instead of resetting to `default_limit` (#57, @litnimax)
- **Search**: `ODOO_MCP_DEFAULT_LIMIT` now applies when clients omit `limit` — previously hardcoded, bypassing the env var in the common case (#61)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Lifespan hooks**: Consolidated duplicated setup/teardown from `run_stdio()` and `run_http()` into a single `_odoo_lifespan()` async context manager passed to FastMCP — transport methods are now thin wrappers
- **Context injection**: All 7 tool functions and 4 resource functions accept `ctx: Context` for client-visible observability — sends info/warning/progress notifications to MCP clients in real time
- **Health endpoint**: `GET /health` HTTP route via FastMCP `custom_route` — returns connection status and version as JSON for load balancers and monitoring
- **Model autocomplete**: FastMCP completion handler returns matching model names when clients request autocomplete for `model` parameters in resource URIs

### Changed
- **Health endpoint**: Simplified response to `status`, `version`, and `connected` only — removed `url`, `database`, `error_metrics`, `recent_errors`, and `performance` fields
- **Tests**: Overhaul test suite — replace fake MCP protocol simulators with real handler calls, mock only at the XML-RPC network boundary, add CRUD/tool/lifespan/completion coverage, remove example-only and mock-asserting tests

### Fixed
- **Boolean formatting**: `False` values displayed as "Not set" instead of "No" in formatted output due to branch precedence bug in `_format_simple_value()`
- **Completion handler**: Returned raw list instead of `Completion(values=...)`, breaking MCP protocol contract
- **Lifespan cleanup**: Connection cleanup didn't run when setup failed because setup was outside the `try` block

## [0.4.5] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Synchronized `--help`, `.env.example`, and README with all current environment variables and test commands
- **CI**: Run lint and unit tests in parallel; gate integration tests to PRs and main/dev branches; add concurrency groups and uv caching
- **Project config**: Clean up `.gitignore`, trim redundant dependencies, consolidate dev tooling config

## [0.4.4] - 2026-02-25

### Changed
- **Connection startup**: `OdooConnection.connect()` resolves the target database *before* creating MCP proxies in standard mode, setting the `X-Odoo-Database` header for `_test_connection()` and all subsequent calls
- **`AccessController` auth**: Supports session-cookie authentication as fallback when no API key is configured — authenticates via `/web/session/authenticate` and retries once on session expiry

### Fixed
- **All standard-mode auth combinations now work**: API-key-only (S1/S2), API-key + user/pass (S3/S4), and user/pass-only (S5/S6) — with or without explicit `ODOO_DB` — all connect, authenticate, and pass access control. Previously S1–S6 could fail with 404 on multi-DB servers
- **Multi-database routing**: Standard mode MCP endpoints (`/mcp/xmlrpc/*`, `/mcp/models`, `/mcp/health`, etc.) returned 404 when multiple databases existed in PostgreSQL because Odoo couldn't determine which DB to route to. Now sends `X-Odoo-Database` header on all MCP requests (XML-RPC and REST)
- **DB endpoint routing**: Database listing now always uses the server-wide `/xmlrpc/db` endpoint instead of `/mcp/xmlrpc/db`, since the latter requires a DB context that isn't available yet

## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-24

### Changed
- **CI**: Reduce Python matrix to 3.10 + 3.13; add YOLO and MCP integration test jobs with Odoo 18 + PostgreSQL 17 Docker containers
- **Test markers**: Rename `integration` → `mcp`, `e2e` → `yolo`, drop `odoo_required`; add markers to 30 previously-invisible tests; remove `RUN_MCP_TESTS` gate
- **CI coverage**: Collect coverage from unit, YOLO and MCP jobs; merge and upload to Codecov

### Fixed
- **Standard mode auth**: `AccessController` no longer crashes at startup when only username/password is configured (without `ODOO_API_KEY`). Now logs a warning and defers auth failure to REST call time with actionable error messages suggesting `ODOO_API_KEY` or YOLO mode

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Docker support**: Multi-stage Dockerfile with `uv` for fast builds, and GitHub Actions workflow for multi-platform images (amd64 + arm64) published to both GHCR and Docker Hub

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Multi-language support**: New `ODOO_LOCALE` environment variable to get Odoo responses in any installed language (e.g. `es_ES`, `fr_FR`, `de_DE`). Validates locale at startup and falls back to default language if not installed. (#23)

### Fixed
- **Models without `name` field**: `create_record` and `update_record` failed on models like `mail.activity` that lack a `name` field due to hardcoded field list in post-operation read-back
- **Version-aware record URLs**: `create_record` and `update_record` now generate `/odoo/{model}/{id}` URLs for Odoo 18+ instead of the legacy `/web#id=...` format (which is still used for Odoo ≤ 17)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Structured output**: All tools return typed Pydantic models with auto-generated JSON schemas for MCP clients (`SearchResult`, `RecordResult`, `ModelsResult`, `CreateResult`, `UpdateResult`, `DeleteResult`)
- **Tool annotations**: All tools declare `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint` via MCP `ToolAnnotations`
- **Resource annotations**: All resources declare `audience` and `priority` via MCP `Annotations`
- **Human-readable titles**: All tools and resources include `title` for better display in MCP clients

### Changed
- **MCP SDK**: Upgraded from `>=1.9.4` to `>=1.26.0,<2`
- **`get_record` structured output**: Returns `RecordResult` with separate `record` and `metadata` fields instead of injecting `_metadata` into record data
- **Tooling**: Replace black/mypy with ruff format/ty for formatting and type checking

### Fixed
- **VertexAI compatibility**: Simplified `search_records` `domain`/`fields` type hints from `Union` to `Optional[Any]` to avoid `anyOf` JSON schemas rejected by VertexAI/Google ADK (#27)
- **Stale record data**: Removed record-level caching from `read()` to prevent returning stale field values (e.g. `active`) when records change in Odoo between calls (#28)
- **Tests**: Integration tests now use `ODOO_URL` for server detection, deduplicated server checks, fixed async test handling, updated assertions for structured output types, halved suite runtime

### Removed
- Legacy error type aliases (`ToolError`, `ResourceError`, `ResourceNotFoundError`, `ResourcePermissionError`) — use `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `PermissionError` directly
- Unused `_setup_handlers()` method from `OdooMCPServer`

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Authentication bypass**: Add missing `@property` on `is_authenticated` — was always truthy as a method reference, bypassing auth guards

### Changed
- Update CI dependencies (black 26.1.0, GitHub Actions v6/v7)
- Server version test validates semver format instead of hardcoded value

## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-14

### Added
- **YOLO Mode**: Development mode for testing without MCP module installation
  - Read-Only: Safe demo mode with read-only access to all models
  - Full Access: Unrestricted access for development (never use in production)
  - Works with any standard Odoo instance via native XML-RPC endpoints

## [0.2.2] - 2025-08-04

### Added
- **Direct Record URLs**: Added `url` field to `create_record` and `update_record` responses for direct access to records in Odoo

### Changed
- **Minimal Response Fields**: Reduced `create_record` and `update_record` tool responses to return only essential fields (id, name, display_name) to minimize LLM context usage
- **Smart Field Optimization**: Implemented dynamic field importance scoring to reduce smart default fields to most essential across all models, with configurable limit via `ODOO_MCP_MAX_SMART_FIELDS`

## [0.2.1] - 2025-06-28

### Changed
- **Resource Templates**: Updated `list_resource_templates` tool to clarify that query parameters are not supported in FastMCP resources

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-19

### Added
- **Write Operations**: Enabled full CRUD functionality with `create_record`, `update_record`, and `delete_record` tools (#5)

### Changed
- **Resource Simplification**: Removed query parameters from resource URIs due to FastMCP limitations - use tools for advanced queries (#4)

### Fixed
- **Domain Parameter Parsing**: Fixed `search_records` tool to accept both JSON strings and Python-style domain strings, supporting various format variations

## [0.1.2] - 2025-06-19

### Added
- **Resource Discovery**: Added `list_resource_templates` tool to provide resource URI template information
- **HTTP Transport**: Added streamable-http transport support for web and remote access

## [0.1.1] - 2025-06-16

### Fixed
- **HTTPS Connection**: Fixed SSL/TLS support by using `SafeTransport` for HTTPS URLs instead of regular `Transport`
- **Database Validation**: Skip database existence check when database is explicitly configured, as listing may be restricted for security
