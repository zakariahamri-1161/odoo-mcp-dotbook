"""Programmable TCP proxy for simulating LB / network failure modes.

Sits between OdooConnection and a real Odoo instance, intercepts traffic, and
exposes hooks to inject the failure modes that are otherwise impossible to
reproduce locally:

- ``silently_drop_upstream()`` — close the upstream socket without notifying
  the client. Models the LB-silent-drop scenario from issue #68: the client's
  cached keepalive socket looks alive at the userspace level, but reads block
  forever (without a socket timeout) or until the OS RTO retransmit gives up.

- ``set_response_delay(seconds)`` — hold each chunk of upstream traffic for N
  seconds before forwarding. Models a slow Odoo backend; useful for verifying
  that legitimate slow operations succeed within the configured timeout.

The proxy is a plain in-process Python TCP forwarder — no toxiproxy or extra
container needed. Designed to live alongside the unit-style perf tests that
already exercise the transport layer in isolation.
